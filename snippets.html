			<h3> Trusting to Confide in Confidence</h3>

			<img src="images/talking_head.jpg" alt="head images: people confiding" class="image_head_size">

				<p>Some people demand that a person confides in them about everything and anything. Is that the way to go about it? <br>
			<span class=”indent”>No! you cant demand from anyone that they confide in you - that comes naturally!</span>
			The basis is a relationship!<br>
			<span class=”indent”>Not that you are my brother, my sister, my father, my mother or my spouse. No!. Are we close? Can I trust you? Do I have your confidence? Do we have an understanding? Am I comfortable around you? Do I feel free to express myself to you?</span>
			Its not just a matter of YES to the above questions. But, how deep? How intense? Is our relationship? How strong is our bond?</p>
			
			<p>You need something to offer, for the confider to find confidence to confide. Something worthy the risk, something intrinsic not extrinsic. Something that makes you the person to believe in. believing in a person enough to pour out your heart to them is in and of itself a great risk. Your faith in that person may be betrayed. Your secrets may be published. One morning all the burdens of your heart may wake up a matter of public consumption. Your garb of privacy stripped off, every minute detail of your life naked and exposed, your dignity negated. You are embarrassed, shamed, confused and humiliated. Therefore people don’t just confide. They look for inner character, love, care and sympathy before they open-up. No-wonder, its not something you can ask for, just be the right person and confidants will come your way.</p>

			<p>Do you know how to listen? Listen in this case is defined, explained and interpreted by the listened not the listener. When I talk,  do you hear my words or my heart speaking? Every emotion, the shivers in my voice, every stammered word…do you decipher all that detail enough to know when to respond and the right word to utter? Do you  know when to laugh? When to cry, when to hold my hand, pat my back, hug or when to laugh? Do you know how to allow every word whispered in your ear to sink in. To feel and internalize the emotion in each and every one of those words. </p>
			<p>Don’t be in their shoes…rather be the other person in verity.<br>
			There are times when a person speaks out, to empty out. Learn to listen silently? It’s not always in the wisdom of your words, sometimes the wisdom of silence is what’s needed. <br> 
			There are times when time is all that the confider needs. Time to sit with you in silence. Not a word said in prolonged stretches of minutes or hours. Those quite moments are deep and beautiful. Can you even make time to be quite with an emotionally exhausted soul? I ask because time is money, and silence seems unproductive. Those you love will know they are worth it to you if you made time for them when needed you not when you could.</p>
			<p>Sometimes a person needs advice, counsel and a different perspective. Your counsels, opinions and perspectives need to be laden with substance and matter. When I first became friends with Jay, she said she loved me because I listened to her without judging and I have her advice that was real, I didn’t lie to her to make her feel</p>
