		<h3>Wisdom of The Wize</h3>
		<h4>Money-Wize</h4>
		<p>In a compilation titled <em>Counsels on Stewardship</em> from the books and artcles that she wrote
		Ellen White said <q>There must be a strict regard to economy, or a heavy debt will be incurred. 
		Keep within bounds. Shun the incurring of debt as you would shun leprosy”</q> (Letter 60, 1896)</p>
		<p>Only if this advice was taken seriously by masses today, how much would be daved from the accruing debt
		of interest on credit cards for things that had there been well planning, thought would not have been expended on.</p>
		<p>Stay alert as we will be discussing debt and our personal financial well being</p> 

		<h3>Street-Wize</h3>
		<h4>Ponzi Schemes</h4>
		<p>There is word in the streets around the United States right now among many young adults. 'there is a very easy way of making extra money'. Who doesn’t want extra money, especially if it's passive income.</p>
		<p>All you have to do is contribute $500 and invite two members to join. In 21 days you get paid $4000. if you want to stay, the circle continues, contribute and invite.</p>
		<p>To a mathematical mind, this series is unsustainable. Where are the funds for pay-offs coming from? New members you are told. If you are lucky to have you two invites and get paid after 21 days, then this is the best thing in town!</p>
		<p>I have a question, how many other two sets of successful invites need to be successful to raise a $4000 for you? Answer is 4! Yes four because eight sets of $500 makes $4000. </p>
		<p>This means for you and your two invites to get paid again next 21 days you there is need for 24 more people to join and contribute their $500. This growth is exponential. Its like a pandemic. Eventually we come to a point where there is no new members joining either no-one can afford the $500 anymore or the whole population has joined. </p>
		<p>What will happen to the last one who joined and contributed their $500s, who cannot invite anyone anymore because there is no one to invite?</p>
		<p>The payouts crash on them. They can't get their refunds, they have paid off those who were due payoff. In this case every day is the 21st day, It means tomorrow there is people expecting payoff, but there is no money, and the day after until the situation explodes</p>
		<p>This is called ponzi or pyramid scheme! Its fraud, it's been here as far back as the 1800s, why is it still successful? Maybe why are flue-like viruses still pandemic in 2020, they have been here since antiquity past, they had other names like plagues back then.</p>
		<p>Wait for the next issue when we delve deeper into ponzi and pyramid schemes</p>

					<h4>The Doctor Behind Chloroquine</h4>
						<blockquote cite="https://www.thedailybeast.com/stella-immanuel-trumps-new-covid-doctor-believes-in-alien-dna-demon-sperm-and-hydroxychloroquine">
							A Houston doctor who praises hydroxychloroquine and says that face masks aren’t necessary to stop transmission of the highly contagious coronavirus has become a star on the right-wing internet, garnering tens of millions of views on Facebook on Monday alone. 
							...<br>
							Immanuel, a pediatrician and a religious minister, has a history of making bizarre claims about medical topics and other issues. She has often claimed that gynecological problems like cysts and endometriosis are in fact caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches. 
							<br>
							She alleges alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments, and that scientists are cooking up a vaccine to prevent people from being religious. ..., she has said that the government is run in part not by humans but by “reptilians” and other aliens.
